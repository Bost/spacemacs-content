# Creating a new file

You can create a new file for the project within Spacemacs, using the usual tools.

## Create a new file from C-x C-f

When you create a new file that has multiple words, use kebab-case for the naming to maintain consistency for the Clojure namespace.

Spacemacs will ask if you want to change the filename to use underscores for the dashes in the name.  Say yes to keep the Java class loader happy.

> What happens if you dont use kebab-case when creating the file ???
