# Troubleshooting

If you need help, you shold check the [Spacemacs documentation](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html), or `M-m h SPC` to see if your issue is covered.  If not, then contact the [Spacemacs Gitter room](https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs) and describe your problem as detailed as possible.

You should include the following information:
- version of spacemacs
- are you on develop or master branch of spacemacs
- version of emacs 
- operating system

If the issue is about languages or other external dependencies, eg. java, javascript, clojure, you should state what versions of those you have installed and how you installed them (eg. downloaded from website, Homebrew on mac, debian/ubuntu package from main repository, etc)
