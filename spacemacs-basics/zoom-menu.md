## Folding code, comments and other content

Code folding is very useful for hiding different levels of detail, for example you could hide everthing but the function signatures in a namespace, showing just the API for that namespace.

Comments and documentation can be folded to help you focus on a specific part of the content.

| Keybinding | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `z a`      | toggle fold of code, comment, section, etc. |
| `z c`      | close fold                                  |
| `z o`      | open fold                                   |
| `z O`      | open fold recursive (capital o)             |
| `z r`      | open folds                                  |


## Scrolling

| Keybinding | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `z b`      | scroll the current line to bottom of buffer |
| `z t`      | scroll the current line to top of buffer    |
