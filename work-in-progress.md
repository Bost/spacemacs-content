### typical copy / cut and paste approach

in normal mode, select the region you want to cut, this puts you into select mode.  Then press `d` to cut (delete) the selected text or `y` to copy (yank into kill ring).  This will put you back into normal mode.

Move the cursor to where you want to paste the text with `p`

### normal & insert mode
`C-j` - insert new line after cursor

### normal mode
`C-k` delete

## Spacemacs cache 

Spacemacs saves the bookmarks in ~/.emacs.d/.cache/bookmarks, and the recent files lise in ~/.emacs.d/.cache/recentf. You can copy these two files somewhere outside of ~/.emacs.d, and copy them back in after re-installing.

In fact, there might be more files in ~/.emacs.d/.cache that you'd like to save. I suggest backing up the entire ~/.emacs.d/.cache and restoring what you miss after re-installation.

For completeness, I'll mention that the locations of these two files are controlled by the variables bookmark-default-file and recentf-save-file.

Deleting structured text in vim

For vanilla evil-mode, `di[` will do it, ie `delete-in-[`. 

With evil-cleverparens you could also use `dif` since cleverparens adds the `f` (form) text-object.

Well, for deleting in parens it would be `di(`. Similarly you can do `delete-in-` with `{`, `"`, and some others.

Similarly `da[` (`delete-around-[`) does the same thing, but includes the brackets.


If you haven't read this, it was something that fundamentally changed how I vim. Just a really key insight.

Buffer management in evil mode


# Source code - Clojure 

Some key sequences I use all the time:
- `SPC TAB` is like `:bp` in vim: switch to the previous buffer.
- `SPC b b` - switch to a buffer by fuzzy matching on the name.
- `SPC p f` - find a file with fuzzy matching in the current project.
- `:A` - switch between test and implementation (in some languages anyway).

Also `SPC b d` deletes the current buffer, which keeps the set of buffers you're matching against with `SPC b b` manageable. Similarly, `SPC p k` deletes all buffers for the current project. Although, you probably don't need to be as concerned about open buffers as I am. :-)

`:A` did seem to work for me in clojure. Ended up finding out that `SPC p T` is `projectile-find-test-file` and `SPC p a` is `projectile-find-other-file` (which goes to the src file if you're in a test file)

actually `SPC p a` toggles between `src` and `test` file



## Madeline & powerline

`SPC t m t` - toggle mode line 

There are other modeline toggles under `SPC t m` that you might explore.

@cpmcdaniel if it's the separators between the things in the modeline that is bothering you, you can change the separator in our `.spacemacs`... I set mine to `nil`, ala:
```
(setq powerline-default-separator nil
        powerline-center-theme t)
```

## Git stuff 

Use Spacemacs as the $EDITOR for git commits?

Spacemacs can be used as the $EDITOR (or $GIT_EDITOR) for editing git commits messages. To enable this you have to add the following line to your dotspacemacs/user-config:

```lisp
(global-git-commit-mode t)
```

## working with buffers

When you want a window to stay put, use `SPC w t`. It calls the function `spacemacs/toggle-current-window-dedication`.
I use it to make sure REPL and shell windows don't accidentally get taken over by new buffers.


When I start up the spacemacs buffer shows a list of recent files. Is there a command to open everything in that list?

quicknir @quicknir 02:25
`SPC f r`
files recent

so, with helm you can mark multiple things and act on all of them

Use `C-j` and `C-k` to move the cursor up and down in the list of recent files.

Use `C-SPC` to mark individual files or mark every listed file with `M-a` and then hitting enter should open everything


## Scrolling In vim mode 
`C-y` - scroll down the buffer so you can see more text at the top of the buffer
`C-e` - scroll up the buffer so you can see more text further down
`C-l` - toggle between centering the current line, moving the current line to the top of the buffer and the original position

## Manipulating case of text 

Case Conversion Commands

Emacs has commands for converting either a single word or any arbitrary range of text to upper case or to lower case.

M-l

    Convert following word to lower case (downcase-word). 
M-u

    Convert following word to upper case (upcase-word). 
M-c

    Capitalize the following word (capitalize-word). 
C-x C-l

    Convert region to lower case (downcase-region). 
C-x C-u

    Convert region to upper case (upcase-region). 

M-l (downcase-word) converts the word after point to lower case, moving past it. Thus, repeating M-l converts successive words. M-u (upcase-word) converts to all capitals instead, while M-c (capitalize-word) puts the first letter of the word into upper case and the rest into lower case. All these commands convert several words at once if given an argument. They are especially convenient for converting a large amount of text from all upper case to mixed case, because you can move through the text using M-l, M-u or M-c on each word as appropriate, occasionally using M-f instead to skip a word.

When given a negative argument, the word case conversion commands apply to the appropriate number of words before point, but do not move point. This is convenient when you have just typed a word in the wrong case: you can give the case conversion command and continue typing.

If a word case conversion command is given in the middle of a word, it applies only to the part of the word which follows point. (This is comparable to what M-d (kill-word) does.) With a negative argument, case conversion applies only to the part of the word before point.

The other case conversion commands are C-x C-u (upcase-region) and C-x C-l (downcase-region), which convert everything between point and mark to the specified case. Point and mark do not move.

The region case conversion commands upcase-region and downcase-region are normally disabled. This means that they ask for confirmation if you try to use them. When you confirm, you may enable the command, which means it will not ask for confirmation again. See Disabling.

# Terminology

Functions

Function refers to the thing that you are calling when you hit a key or series of keys. For example j in normal modeis mapped to the function evil-next-line. In elisp these usually look like strings of hyphenated words. spc spc opens helm M-x and lets you search for functions by name and execute them. Note that functions may also be refered to as sexps (symbolic expressions).
Buffers

Buffers are like tabs in your browser. You open them from files on your computer instead of from the internet, and they stay open until you close them. Hit spc b b to see a searchable list of your open buffers, and recently opened buffers. spc b B opens a list of buffers organized by major mode. spc b d deletes the buffer you are currently in. As you can most the spc b commands are related to buffers. But buffers arent necessarily just files you open, they can also be generated by emacs (like the helm mini buffer (spc b b) you use to search buffers) to do useful things.
The Mode Line

At the bottom of the window, you will see the mode line. Its got some handy information in it. From left to right it shows you:

    Your window number. The color indicates what evil mode you are in (normal, insert, etc)
    A little * indicator if your file has been modified since it has been saved.
    Buffer size.
    Buffer name (same as file name if you have opened from file).
    Major mode.
    Minor modes.

On the far right is info about where you are in a buffer. Move around whth hjkl and watch it if you dont get it at first.
Major Modes

This is how emacs organizes important sets of functionality. Each buffer will have one major mode at a time. It can customize anything about emacs so that it suits the buffer you are working with. There is a mode for editing C#, a mode for editing latex, a mode for viewing files (dired-mode), a mode for searching (helm-major-mode), a mode for emulating a terminal (term-mode). You can see what major mode you are in at the bottom of each buffer in your mode line. Usually this is automatically set depending on which buffer you are in. Major modes specific functions are on the , key (also spc m).
Minor Modes

Minor modes are smaller sets of custom behavior that can work together. A major mode will automatically set a bunch of relevant minor modes, but you can toggle them with spc t. For example spc t n toggles a minor mode for line numbers. You can hover over the symbols in the modeline with your mouse to see what minor mode each represents. spc h d m (help describe mode) opens a comprehensive list of your active minor modes. Move your cursor to one and hit enter to get more information.

Side Note: The information opens in a split buffer titled *help*. Many of these buffers that are meant to be temporary can be closed quickly with q.
Layers

Everything so far (except specific key bindings) applies to emacs in general. Layers, however, are a spacemacs specific term. Layers are meant to be a simple way for you to customize your configuration by adding only one line to your .spacemacs file. See the list to see what are available. Check out the latex layer for example.
The .spacemacs file

Hit spc f e d (file emacs dotfile) to open this file. This is where you can customize everything. Find the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers line. You can use / in normal mode to start searching for it and enter when you have it. Add latex in that list. It should look like this:

dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
  latex
  other-layer
  other-layer)

Now spacemacs will load that layer on startup for you, which includes a major mode for editing latex and a bunch of commands. You can now either restart emacs, or hit spc f e R(file emacs reload) to reload your config. Now if you hit spc f f (file find) and open a latex file you should have some syntax highlighting and latex specific commands on your , key.

## Why Vim ?

### Positives 

* Cut the Mouse - One of the main wins for Vim has always been that it is an editor that lets you keep your hands on the keyboard. Reaching for the mouse slows you down, and while I never really had a problem with that in the past (I spend more time thinking and reading than I do writing code), now that Iâ€™ve experienced 2 months with my hands on the keyboard I do find myself noticing (annoyingly) when I am forced to reach for the mouse.

* Fast Navigation - Moving around inside files in most windows editors involves a lot of home/end/up/down arrow key. Having search and tag based navigation makes getting around within a file much faster. Finding the right file is also easier with the commandt plugin, influenced by Textmate on the Mac, this fuzzy file finder is not typically available in traditional windows editors (last time I looked)

* Split Windows - Splitting windows into panes and navigating around them is a killer feature that I use all the time to see multiple files at once, or multiple areas of the same file at once. In the past I used tabs heavily, but I now prefer split panes that I can manage without reaching for the mouse.


### Negatives

    HJKL - Sorry, call me a heretic but I just cannot get used to using these keys for up/down/left/right. 20+ years of using the arrow keys is completely and utterly embedded in my brain. Besides, Iâ€™m pretty sure J (down) and K (up) are bass-ackwards. Western languages, and presumably most programming languages, read from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT so shouldnâ€™t UP be next to LEFT and DOWN be next to RIGHT ??? I know I could remap the keys, but plugins that follow similar patterns would also have to be remapped and I just could not get used to it.

    Mode Struggles - The modal nature of Vim is both a blessing and a curse. Its the feature that allows us to keep our hands on the keyboards without the wrist breaking key comboâ€™s of Emacs but its also far too easy to forget which mode you are in and start typing code only to discover you just executed 5 random commands. The people who recommend you ESC constantly back into command mode are absolutely correct. You have to shift your thinking into being primarily command based with short sharp bursts of INSERT.

    Breaking Windows - One of the side effects of the modal nature of vim is that it trains you to constantly hit ESCAPE to go back to command modeâ€¦. but when you do this in more traditional windows apps its quite possible you will end up dismissing a dialog while you are in the middle of typing! How frustrating! I hit this mostly when using Tortoise SVN for my code commits.

    Disappointing Plugins - Whilst some plugins are awesome, some are surprisingly disappointing. While I was really looking forward to them, the following plugins just didnâ€™t get as much use as I expected session (doesnâ€™t work well with NERDTree or quickfix window), taglist (doesnâ€™t work well with dynamic languages - at the moment I use primarily Ruby and Javascript), Conque Shell - (nice idea, but doesnâ€™t feel natural, just easier to use :shell or have another terminal open)

Effort vs Reward

Ok. So I have a theoryâ€¦

Vim proponents will tell you that the effort you spend learning vim will pay dividends in the long run once you know how to use it properly. After 60 days I can say that I agree with that opinion.

However, if I spent this much effort learning any editor I think it would pay dividends in the long run. The difference is that Vim forces you to go through this pain, whilst other editors work â€˜out the boxâ€™ and so most programmers are not inclined to learn the power of those editors.

For example, I think UltraEdit, TextMate, even Visual Studio are pretty good editors, but since they all pretty much just work out of the box, its easy to ignore their advanced features and not spend the time customizing and configuring them.

I wonder if I spent 60 days really learning UltraEdit if I couldnâ€™t get the same positives I described here ? Hmmm, a future article maybe?
Conclusion

Iâ€™m still using Vim after 60 days, and I plan to continue using it for the foreseeable future as long as I can keep taking a little time here and there to dig deeper, customize a bit more, learn how to overcome the negatives and build upon the positives.

Vim seems to be so powerful that I could be learning it forever. Hereâ€™s a list of some of the things I want to spend time on in the future.

    Movement - I need to learn more code related movement commands like % match
    Sessions - Both sessions.vim and sessionman.vim seem to struggle with NERDTree and the quickfix window
    Cut & Paste - I need to learn more about vim registers so I can manage my cut & paste better, errr, sorry, I mean yank & put
    Undo & Redo - I think I spend too much time in insert mode so when I undo it tends to be more than Iâ€™d like
    HJKL - Maybe I should remap to swap the J and K keys and try again!
    More Plugins - There are many more plugins I would like to take the time to check out, and perhaps build some of my own.
