# Before You Start with Spacemacs and Clojure development

## [Install Emacs](install-emacs.html)
Spacemacs is a configuration for Emacs, so you need to install Emacs before you can use Spacemacs.  Everything else defined here is required for Clojure development.

## [Install Clojure](install-clojure.html)
This workshop uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) as the project automation tool for Clojure.  It will help you create and run projects, as well as create build assets (jars) for deployment.

Clojure is a hosted language, so requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), provided by installing the Java JRE or Java SDK.
