# Choose your Spacemacs experience

Once you have a copy of Spacemacs in `~/.emacs.d`, then run Emacs to install and configure the basics of Spacemacs.

For this workshop I recommend **Evil style**, **standard distribution** and **helm completion**.

## Editing style (Evil / Vim)

This workshop uses Evil style editing, although does include Emacs keybindings too.

Selecting Evil mode will set Vim to be the default way of using Emacs, however, all the typical Emacs keybindings will be available (via `C-z`).

If you select just holy mode then only Emacs mode is available as Evil mode will not be installed.

> ####Hint::
> In Holy Mode (Emacs keybindings) the keybinding `M-x` is used to access the Spacemacs menu, rather than `SPC`


## Spacemacs distribution (Standard)

Choose the standard distribution of Spacemacs to get all the standard features.


## Completion Framework (Helm)

A completion framework helps you type less and find commands and file names quickly.  Helm is the framework that is the most common and has more features than Ivy.

## Spacemacs is ready for action

Now you should have Spacemacs up and running and ready to take on the world.

In the next section we will configure Spacemacs for Clojure.
