# Spacemacs Quickstart

When you open a Clojure `.clj` or `.cljs` file then Spacemacs will ask you if you want to install the Clojure Layer.

Saying yes will add **clojure** to the `~/.spacemacs` configuration and download all the relevant packages (from elpa, melpa).

Once the Clojure packages have downloaded, you are ready to use all the Clojure features.
