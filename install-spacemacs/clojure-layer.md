# Adding Clojure to Spacemacs

When you open a Clojure file, a file ending in `.clj` or `.cljs` then Spacemacs will ask you if you want to install the Clojure.

If you say yes, and you should, then Spacemacs will update its configuration file, `~/.spacemacs` to include the clojure layer and download all the relevant packages (from elpa, melpa).

Once the Clojure packages have downloaded, you are ready to use all the Clojure features.
