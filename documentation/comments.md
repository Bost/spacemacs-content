# Comments 


# Creating sections for comments 

If you want to divide up your code into sections using comments, rather than type or copy/paste a line of comments you can use Spacemacs character repeat command (is that the real name?)

Hold down the control key and press the relevant number key, then release both and press the character you wish to repeat.

If you want more than a single digit value, then hold the control key and press the first number, then rease both keys and press the remaining numbers followed by the character to repeat.

## Examples

`C-7 ;`
`C-24 ;`
`C-80 ;`
