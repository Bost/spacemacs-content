## Slurp & Barf

These are the most commonly used tools I use when coding in Clojure


**Slurp** brings something inside, like a noisy person eating soup

**Barf** expelling something, like someone who has consumed so very bad food (or drunk too much)


C-( -- pull an element in from the left
C-) -- pull an element in from the right

M-( -- push an element out to the left
M-) -- push an element out to the right
