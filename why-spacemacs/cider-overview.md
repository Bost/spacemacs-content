# CIDER - the Clojure experience for Emacs

[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) provides a comprehensive range of tools to create quality Clojure code.

Starting a REPL (Clojure runtime environment) from Spacemacs allows you to evaluate one or more expressions and see the results in your code buffer, giving extremely fast feedback on the behaviour of your code.  You also have a separate REPL buffer that will evaluate expressions.
