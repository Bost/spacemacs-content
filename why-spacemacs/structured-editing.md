## Smartparens and symbol balancing/highlighting

Smartparents helps speed up typing and reducing errors due to unmatched symbols.  For most symbols in most modes a matching symbol is created.  So if you type `(` then a matching `)` is created too.  If you want to surround some existing text with a symbol pair, then simply highlight the text and press the opening symbol.  A closing symbol is also highlighted when the cursor is at the opening symbol.  Spacemacs also highlights the surrounding symbols, including any parents.  So if you are in a nested list, `(parent code (nested code))`, then if the cursor is on the nested code, both nested & parent symbols are highlighted.
