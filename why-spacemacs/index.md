# Why Spacemacs

Spacemacs provides highly productive tooling for any software development, supporting numerous languages and common development tools.

Spacemacs is fast to startup and lightweight thanks to its lazy loading of features.  It only loads in those features you need.

The rest of this section goes into more details as to why you would choose Spacemacs for your developer life, including:

* easy to use configuration using [layers](layers.html) (rather than configuring individual packages)
    * Clojure layer provides full [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) & [clj-refactor](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el) support
* [Easily discover commands with mnemonic menu](mnemonic-menu.html)
* [Helm narrowing & completion](helm.html)
* [Simplifying keybindings with multiple states](states.html)
    * [Transient State menus for repetitive actions](transient-state-menus.html)
* [Structured editing with Smartparens and Lisp mode](structured-editing.html)
