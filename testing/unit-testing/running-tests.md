> #### Hint::Run tests from test code buffer
> Run tests from the buffer containing the test source code buffer, as this ensures all test code is loaded and the latest version of the tests are run.

> Tests can be run from the source code buffer, however, only test code that has been evaluated in the REPL will run.
