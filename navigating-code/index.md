# Navigating code

Rather than use the arrow keys to move character by character or line by line, Spacemacs enables you to move around much quicker


* `SPC /` - move by searching
* ... - navigating structure (also see structural editing)
* `SPC z .` - folding code blocks
* ... - folding comments


## Classic Emacs movements

Dont forget there is also the classic Emacs and Vi movements

> **FIXME** link back to emacs and vi basics
