# Switching to the REPL

Although a REPL buffer is created it is not displayed by default.

> My typical workflow is to evaluate functions and expressions within the Clojure code buffer itself.

> * I've proposed a change to create a new menu entry for switching the repl to the current namespace of the code buffer, `cider-repl-set-ns`: S - cider-repl-set-ns


## Switching between Code & REPL

You can toggle between a Clojure code buffer and a REPL buffer with `M-RET s s`.  As this is the same binding for both switching to a REPL and switching to the last code buffer, this enables you to toggle between the two quickly.

## Select the REPL namespace

When in a Clojure code buffer you can switch the namespace of the REPL using `cider-repl-set-ns`.

With the REPL buffer active,  `cider-repl-set-ns` will display a pop-up buffer and list all the available namespaces.
