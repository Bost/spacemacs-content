# Working with Projects

You can navigate the directories of your project using find files, as we have seen with opening a file.  This works well when adding individual files as you work on them.  You can then switch between these files using buffer commands, `SPC b`

## File, Buffer and Project menus

Spacemacs gives you several options for managing the files in your project and you will use commands from the following menus

* File
* Buffer
* Project

When starting a new project, you can use the **File** menu to open a file from the project, eg. `project.clj`.  Once one file is open from a project you can use the **Project** menu to open a file, `SPC p f` or switch to the buffer of other file, `SPC p b`.

When you want to switch to an already open file outside the project you can use the **Buffer** menu, `SPC b b`.

If you want to open a file outside of the current project, then use the **File** menu to find the file, `SPC f f`.

When creating a new file, use the **File Find** command, `SPC f f` and enter the full path and name of the new file.  You are prompted to confirm that you want a new file created.
