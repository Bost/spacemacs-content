# Installing Source Control

Recommended layers to add for source control include:

* `git` - provides Magit, a feature rich git client that is easy to use
* `github` - accessing GitHub repositories and Gists
* `version-control` - general features including diff highlights in the window fringe

You must [configure Git](git-configuraiton.html) and should also [add SSH keys and a personal access token](source-code/github-configuration.md) to get the most out of Spacemacs source control with Git.
