# Changing commit History

Existing commit history can be modified with [squash](commit-squash.md), [fixup](commit-fixup.md) and [augment](commit-augment.md).

The need to change history in Git should be minimal and should limited to fixing errors made in previous commits on your local repository.

Here are a few simple tools to help you change your local history.

> #### Hint:: Consentual Shared Remote History rewriting
> If you need to change commit history on a share repository then think about how many people it is going to affect.  If you really must change a shared git history, get consent from the people you will affect first.
>
> It is much simpler to commit a new change that fixes the omission or error and let others pull that additional change.
