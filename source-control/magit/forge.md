# Magit Forge
Magit Forge is used to talk to GitHub, GitLab and similar services, collectively referred to as forges.

Forge can retrieve the list of issues and pull requests from a remote repository. Issues, pull requests and forks can be created on a remote repository.

`@` opens the forge menu from the Magit Status buffer, `, g s`, and therefore requires a local Git repository.

> #### Hint::Requires Forge Configuration
> [Configure forge with your remote repository](/source-control/forge-configuration.md) before using the forge commands.


## Using Magit Forge
Add each repository to the forge database before running other forge commands.  The create fork command will automatically add the new repository to the forge.

`a` to add a remote repository to the forge database, defaulting to the URL of the current remote repository for the project.

`r` switches between forks where multiple have been added to the forge database.

Using forge commands before adding the repository will cause an error

## List issues
`l i` opens a buffer with a list of issues with the most recent at the top.  Issue labels also show in the list using the the color assigned on GitHub.

In the issue list buffer:

`o` opens the list in the default browser

`j` to navigate down, `k` to navigate up the list

`q` to quit and close the buffer


## Create an issue
`c i` to create a new issue on the current repository.

`RET` on the issue opens the issue and shows the details.  Related issues are shown as a link, `RET` on the link opens the related issue in the browser.

## Create a pull request
Assumes you have a fork and original repository as remotes added to the local git repository.

Create a branch on the fork with a descriptive name of the change you want to submit as a pull request.  Commit changes to that new branch.

`P p` to push the change to the remote repository for the fork.

`@` to open the forge menu from the Magit Status buffer.

`r` to select the repository that the pull request will be created on (eg. the upstream repository, not the fork).

`c p` to create a new pull request.

For the source repository, select the branch of the local fork repository.

The description of the change is show and can be edited for the pull request description.
