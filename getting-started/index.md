# Getting started with Spacemacs

With Emacs 25.1 installed, simply clone or download the Spacemacs configuration, first moving any existing `~/.emacs.d` Emacs configuration out of the way.

Use your favourite git client or the following command in a terminal window:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Then run Emacs as normal.  Spacemacs will start installing a few key packages and then go on to ask you how you want your Spacemacs.
