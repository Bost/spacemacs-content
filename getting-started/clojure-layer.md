# Adding Clojure to Spacemacs

When you open a Clojure file, a file ending in `.clj` or `.cljs` then Spacemacs will ask you if you want to install the Clojure.

If you say yes, and you should, then Spacemacs will update its configuration file, `~/.spacemacs` to include the clojure layer and download all the relevant packages (from elpa, melpa).

Once the Clojure packages have downloaded, you are ready to use all the Clojure features.

## Manually adding the clojure layer

To add the clojure layer yourself we simply edit the `~/.spacemacs` configuration file.  Spacemacs helps us do this with the keybinding:

`SPC f e d`  or `M-m f e d` if in Emacs mode

> The Spacemacs menu system is nemonic, so the letters stand for: File, Edit and Dotfile


To add a layer, find the function `dotspacemacs/layers` and section `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` add the name of the layer you want to include.

For example, see [my full Spacemacs configuration](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/065ab83a0ddf6da9848d7847b7dd7704) to see my layers configuration.

> Trying to use packages-list-packages to install packages directly is simply ignored by Spacemacs.  See how to [configure a package without a layer](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#without-a-layer) in the Spacemacs documentation.


For a basic Clojure environment you only need to add the **clojure** layer.

For a full development environment for Clojure, I suggest adding the **auto-completion**, **clojure**, **git**, **html**, **javascript**, **markdown**, **org-mode**, **syntax-checking** and **version control** layers to the `dotspacemacs/layers` function in `~/.spacemacs`

After saving the changes to `~/.spacemacs` the configuration was reloaded with `M-m f e R`.  As I installed a lot of packages, I also restarted Emacs once everything had finished.

```lisp
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
     ;; Example of useful layers you may want to use right away.
     ;; Uncomment some layer names and press <SPC f e R> (Vim style) or
     ;; <M-m f e R> (Emacs style) to install them.
     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
     auto-completion
     better-defaults
     clojure
     emacs-lisp
     git
     html
     javascript
     markdown
     org
     syntax-checking
     version-control
     )
```


## Reload Configuration or Restart Emacs

You can either reload the `~/.spacemacs` configuration using `SPC f e R` or quit Emacs `C-x C-c` and restart Emacs again.

> Hint: If adding a new layer, I recommend restarting Emacs to ensure all the new packages are installed and configured.


## Available Layers

Using Helm is an easy way to see what layers are already available in Spacemacs, using the keyboard combo `M-m f e h`.  This gives you a list of all layers and if you hit return on any of the layer names you are taken to the docs for that layer.

You can also create your own layers with `M-m configuration-layer/create-layer`.  See http://thume.ca/howto/2015/03/07/configuring-spacemacs-a-tutorial/ for more info as well as the Spacemacs docs.
